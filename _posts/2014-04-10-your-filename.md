<p>The Lunada Literary Lounge and Open Mic is a monthly gathering in the Mission District. It happens every full moon - people come together at the Galería de la Raza on 24th street and Bryant to share poems, stories, and songs. Lunada is one of the only regular bilingual open mics in the Bay Area, and it's been happening for 14 years. The people who come to the Lunada every month say it's important to have arts organizations that support Latinos, especially at a time when so much in the city is changing.</p>
 
<p>We went to check it out and produced this piece for Crosscurrents on KALW 91.7.</p>
 
<p>This fall will be Lunada's 15th season - look out for a year-long quinceañera bash!</p>
